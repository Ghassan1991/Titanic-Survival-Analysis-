**Project Overview**

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using SQL and Power BI to uncover insights about passenger survival rates based on various factors such as gender, age, class, and fare category.

Insights from the Analysis

Overall Survival Rate: About 67% of the selected passengers survived.

Gender Influence:

Females had a higher survival rate (33% Female, 67% Male among survivors).

The "Women and Children First" rule seems to apply.

Age Group Survival Trends:

Children (0-9 years) had the highest survival rate (~80%).

Older passengers (60+) had the lowest survival rate (~33%).

Class & Survival:

First-class passengers had the highest survival rate.

Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rate.

Embarkation Port:

Passengers embarking from certain ports had higher survival rates.

Fare Influence:

Higher fare categories were linked to better survival chances.
